'Figalpha.pdf' is not included in the paper, but its results are briefly mentioned in the **Model** section.
This figure shows time evolution of (**a**) group performance and (**b**) opinion diversity with $\alpha=0.1$, $\alpha=0.5$, and $\alpha=0.9$ for the initial condition SH.
All results are obtained with $N=4$ and $T=10$ up to an iteration time of $t_f=100$.
Averages are taken over $1,000$ runs. Solid lines represent the averages, while the shaded regions denote the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals.
