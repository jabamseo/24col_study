## Opinion dynamics model of collaborative learning

### **Jibeom Seo**, Beom Jun Kim

We propose a simple model to explore an educational phenomenon where the correct answer emerges from group discussion.
We construct our model based on several plausible assumptions: (i) We tend to follow peers' opinions.
However, if a peer's opinion is too different from yours, you are not much influenced.
In other words, your opinion tends to align with peers' opinions, weighted by the similarity to yours.
(ii) Discussion among group members helps the opinion to shift toward the correct answer even when the group members do not know it clearly.
However, if everyone tells exactly the same, you often get lost and it becomes more difficult to find the correct answer.
In other words, you can find the correct answer when everyone has largely different voices. (iii) We are sometimes stuck to our past.
If you keep opinions for a long time, such a memory works like an inertia in classical mechanics, hindering the group from finding the correct answer.
We use our model to perform numerical investigations and find that the performance of a group is enhanced when initial opinions are diverse,
that a lower memory capacity makes consensus occur faster, and that a small group size, typically three or four, is beneficial for better group performance.
